# metatools
Tools for saving, checking, and storing extra metadata in ROS parameters.

### nodes

`versionpub.py`
Sets parameters with Git version of each source package you specify, so that 
this information can be saved with other experiment metadata. Also allows you
to set and store parameters with uncommitted changes.

TODO move `snapshot_params.py` node back here from my `multi_tracker` repo?

TODO maybe use a more industry friendly license for this package?
